## Project Plan
### What will we implement?
We plan to develop a website using nextjs where you can create an account then login to chat and interact with other people using text, voice and perhaps video.

### Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Typescript, Javascript, html
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** [Node, React, Nextjs, Tailwindcss]
- **Database:** TBD

### Build System
We will use **npm** for managing dependencies and building the project. 

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Zwee42/TMUK14Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd TMUK14Project/hellosociallife
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Running the project as

    4.1 Development:
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
   
    4.2 Production:     
    ```sh
    npm run build
    npm run start
    ```
5. Automated Tests


   5.1   To run the test suite, use the following command
    ```sh
   npm run test
   ```
    - This will execute all defined unit tests and display the results in the terminal.


   5.2 To run tests with coverage reporting enabled, use:
     ```sh
   npm run test:coverage
   ```
     - This generates a coverage report, indicating how much of your codebase is covered by tests. The report includes details on statements, branches, functions, and lines tested.


   5.3 To check your code for linting errors, use:
    ```sh
   npm run lint

   ```  
   - This will highlight any syntax or style issues in your codebase.
